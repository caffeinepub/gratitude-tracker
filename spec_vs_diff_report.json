  "summary": "The diff implements most of REQ-6, REQ-7, and REQ-8. Core components (PlantGarden, Plant, Branch, plantGrouping utils) are present with correct stage logic, tooltips, reactive updates, horizontal scroll layout, view toggle, and animations. A minor gap exists: seed-stage plants do not render leaf/branch representations of their single entry.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Each gratitude entry for a subject is visually represented as a branch or leaf on its corresponding plant.",
      "reason": "In Plant.tsx, branches/leaves are only rendered when stage !== 'seed'. A plant at the seed stage (1 entry) has no visual leaf/branch representation of that entry, violating the AC that every gratitude entry must be visually represented as a branch or leaf.",
