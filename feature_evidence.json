      "featureTitle": "Create an interactive plant/tree visualization view. Group all gratitude entries by their category/subject — each unique category becomes its own plant. Render each plant as an animated, growing tree or plant illustration using React Three Fiber (Three.js) or SVG-based 2D rendering. The plant starts as a seed when there is 1 entry, grows into a sprout with 2–3 entries, a sapling with 4–6 entries, and a full tree with 7+ entries. Each individual gratitude entry for a subject is represented as a branch or leaf on that plant. Display the subject/category label beneath each plant. Tapping or hovering a branch/leaf reveals the gratitude text for that entry in a tooltip or popover.",
